# GHZ200 Free Roam Landscape (Sonic Generations)

Replaces **Green Hill Zone – Act 2 (Modern)** (`ghz200`) with a **large free-roam landscape map** (mountains surrounding the area, trees, rocks, lakes/ponds, flowers).

Goal: a clean space to **run fast, explore, and test movement** — not an “infinite open world” and no objectives.

> Requires: a legal copy of **Sonic Generations (2011)** + **HedgeModManager**.
